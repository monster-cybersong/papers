However, reducing the computational cost of SNNs remains a critical\nchallenge for developing ultra-efficient intracortical neural implants. In this\nwork, we introduce a novel adaptive pruning algorithm specifically designed for\nSNNs with high activation sparsity, targeting intracortical neural decoding.\nOur method dynamically adjusts pruning decisions and employs a rollback\nmechanism to selectively eliminate redundant synaptic connections without\ncompromising decoding accuracy. Experimental evaluation on the NeuroBench\nNon-Human Primate (NHP) Motor Prediction benchmark shows that our pruned\nnetwork achieves performance comparable to dense networks, with a maximum\ntenfold improvement in efficiency. Moreover, hardware simulation on the\nneuromorphic processor reveals that the pruned network operates at sub-$\\mu$W\npower levels, underscoring its potential for energy-constrained neural\nimplants.

This work aims to evaluate the effectiveness of spiking neural\nnetworks on neuromorphic processors in human activity recognition for wearable\napplications. The case of workout recognition with wrist-worn wearable motion\nsensors is used as a study. A multi-threshold delta modulation approach is\nutilized for encoding the input sensor data into spike trains to move the\npipeline into the event-based approach. The spikes trains are then fed to a\nspiking neural network with direct-event training, and the trained model is\ndeployed on the research neuromorphic platform from Intel, Loihi, to evaluate\nenergy and latency efficiency. Test results show that the spike-based workouts\nrecognition system can achieve a comparable accuracy (87.5\\%) comparable to the\npopular milliwatt RISC-V bases multi-core processor GAP8 with a traditional\nneural network ( 88.1\\%) while achieving two times better energy-delay product\n(0.66 \\si{\\micro\\joule\\second} vs. 1.32 \\si{\\micro\\joule\\second}).",

        "summary": "Compelling evidence has been given for the high energy efficiency and update\nrates of neuromorphic processors, with performance beyond what standard Von\nNeumann architectures can achieve. Such promising features could be\nadvantageous in critical embedded systems, especially in robotics. To date, the\nconstraints inherent in robots (e.g., size and weight, battery autonomy,\navailable sensors, computing resources, processing time, etc.), and\nparticularly in aerial vehicles, severely hamper the performance of\nfully-autonomous on-board control, including sensor processing and state\nestimation. In this work, we propose a spiking neural network (SNN) capable of\nestimating the pitch and roll angles of a quadrotor in highly dynamic movements\nfrom 6-degree of freedom Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. With only 150\nneurons and a limited training dataset obtained using a quadrotor in a real\nworld setup, the network shows competitive results as compared to\nstate-of-the-art, non-neuromorphic attitude estimators. The proposed\narchitecture was successfully tested on the Loihi neuromorphic processor\non-board a quadrotor to estimate the attitude when flying. Our results show the\nrobustness of neuromorphic attitude estimation and pave the way towards\nenergy-efficient, fully autonomous control of quadrotors with dedicated\nneuromorphic computing systems.",

        "summary": "Biological sensing and processing is asynchronous and sparse, leading to\nlow-latency and energy-efficient perception and action. In robotics,\nneuromorphic hardware for event-based vision and spiking neural networks\npromises to exhibit similar characteristics. However, robotic implementations\nhave been limited to basic tasks with low-dimensional sensory inputs and motor\nactions due to the restricted network size in current embedded neuromorphic\nprocessors and the difficulties of training spiking neural networks. Here, we\npresent the first fully neuromorphic vision-to-control pipeline for controlling\na freely flying drone. Specifically, we train a spiking neural network that\naccepts high-dimensional raw event-based camera data and outputs low-level\ncontrol actions for performing autonomous vision-based flight. The vision part\nof the network, consisting of five layers and 28.8k neurons, maps incoming raw\nevents to ego-motion estimates and is trained with self-supervised learning on\nreal event data. The control part consists of a single decoding layer and is\nlearned with an evolutionary algorithm in a drone simulator. Robotic\nexperiments show a successful sim-to-real transfer of the fully learned\nneuromorphic pipeline. The drone can accurately follow different ego-motion\nsetpoints, allowing for hovering, landing, and maneuvering\nsideways$\\unicode{x2014}$even while yawing at the same time. The neuromorphic\npipeline runs on board on Intel's Loihi neuromorphic processor with an\nexecution frequency of 200 Hz, spending only 27 $\\unicode{x00b5}$J per\ninference.

However, deploying robust\napplications to these devices is complicated by limited controllability over\nanalog hardware parameters, as well as unintended parameter and dynamical\nvariations of analog circuits due to fabrication non-idealities. Here we\ndemonstrate a novel methodology for ofDine training and deployment of spiking\nneural networks (SNNs) to the mixed-signal neuromorphic processor DYNAP-SE2.\nThe methodology utilizes gradient-based training using a differentiable\nsimulation of the mixed-signal device, coupled with an unsupervised weight\nquantization method to optimize the network's parameters. Parameter noise\ninjection during training provides robustness to the effects of quantization\nand device mismatch, making the method a promising candidate for real-world\napplications under hardware constraints and non-idealities.
